# Create-unit-tests-REID

By using the unit testing I am able to see that my classes are fully functional and working as intended.  This also can help me tell if they are secure. The biggest insight that helped me see why unit testing was so important is it could follow the userâ€™s requirements and needs.  By taking the requirements I was able to develop test cases that then I could build classes around the solid test cases. It made it a lot easier to read and write each class. After finishing one test I would use the same format that helped me develop the other test. This makes the code easy to follow and read.
